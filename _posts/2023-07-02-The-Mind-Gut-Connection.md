[Mind-Gut-Connection](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51F4fxCl+TL.jpg)

I came across this book online and it immediately caught my attention and I started flipping the pages the very next day. The Mind is indeed a mysterious organ for most. How it works, not even the best medical professionals are able to say, but as it is known for any other organ or living being, it is up to you on how you treat it. This book talks about just that, how by treating another part of your body well, one can influence the mind and be able to keep it healthy.

The book is split into 3 parts, where part 1 talks about how the mind-body connection is real, how the gut talks to the brain, and vice-versa and Microbe-Speak, which is a key component of the gut-brain dialogue. Essentially, this part of the book talks about how our body is an intelligent supercomputer.

Part 2 talks about intuition, Gut Feelings, how Gut-Based decisions are formed in the body, and what could be the possible factors influencing it.

Part 3 discusses the role of Food, and how can humans optimize brain-gut health, based on several experiments and research that medical professionals and doctors, and Neuro-Scientists have done for many years. In the end, the author lists down simple to-dos for wellness and optimal health.

## Why did I pick this book?

Apart from being a curious person and someone who always wishes to know the answers to questions that pop up in my mind randomly, I have not been following a proper diet for the last several years and did fall sick repeatedly. In hindsight, it does feel like common sense that it could have happened due to the mismanagement of my body and what I consumed over a period of time. Understanding the science behind how diet and lifestyle play a huge role in optimal health and well-being indeed sparked my interest to read the book. 

## What was my takeaway?

Lots. The book covers various topics such as hunter-gatherers, primitive humans' diets, modern diets and lifestyles, Gut-brain Axis, Chemicals in the brain, the organs surrounding the Gut, and lots more. My Biggest Takeaway from the book has been the magic that happens inside the body can't be put into words, and that the human body does have a second brain (kinda) in the form of Gut. The Gut-Brain dialogue that happens all the time is very critical to what you think about, your mood, your brain chemicals, and your overall well-being, so it is very important that one eats healthy and very limited. The Gut also is home to thousands of microbe species that behave according to what is fed to them and which plays a crucial role in communicating with the brain and in treating its neighboring organs. 

## Simple Ways to Optimal Health

Well, this is according to the author. The author suggests that if a certain lifestyle is followed, it could provide optimal health and well-being. They are;
